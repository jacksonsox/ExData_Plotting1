## Assignment Objective

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: [Github to fork - ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)

For each plot you should

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
* Name each of the plot files as 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚙𝚗𝚐, etc.
* Create a separate R code file (𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚁, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁 constructs the 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐 plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
* Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
* When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files, a total of eight files in the top-level folder of the repo.

The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below...

## Fork the Github repository

... forked - check
[Forked Github - - ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/jacksonsox/ExData_Plotting1)

## Read the Electric Power Consumption Data

### Set working directoy
```{r setWorkingDirectory, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
setwd("~/Documents/Development/Coursera/Class 4/Git")
```

### Load necessary libraries
```{r loadLibraries, cache=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
if (!require(DT)) {
    install.packages("DT")
}
library(DT)
if(!require(dplyr)) {
    install.packages("dplyr")
}
library(dplyr)
if(!require(lubridate)) {
    install.packages("lubridate")
}
library(lubridate)
```

### Load the electric power data
Check that the file exsits
Read the file named household_power_consumption with ';' separator and headings
```{r loadFile, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
fileNameLoc <- "../data/household_power_consumption.txt"
if (!file.exists(fileNameLoc)) {
    return()
}

housePowerConsume <- read.csv(fileNameLoc, header = TRUE, sep = ";", na.strings = "?")
```

```{r showDets, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
DT::datatable(head(housePowerConsume, 4), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
str(housePowerConsume)
```

### Get the 2 days needed
Get data from 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02
We will use housePowerConsume2Day going forward
```{r getTwoDays, eval=TRUE}
housePowerConsume2Day <- housePowerConsume %>% filter(housePowerConsume$Date == "1/2/2007" | housePowerConsume$Date == "2/2/2007")

DT::datatable(head(housePowerConsume2Day, 4), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
str(housePowerConsume2Day)
```

## Generate the date/time field needed
Create a date time field from the Date and Time fields
```{r createDateTime, eval=TRUE}
housePowerConsume2Day$DateTime <- dmy_hms(paste(housePowerConsume2Day$Date, housePowerConsume2Day$Time))
```

## Generate Plot 4 as a PNG
Create a graph of containing 4 pannels

1. Plot 1
2. Voltage vs. datetime
3. Plot 3
4. Global_reactive_power vs. datetime

```{r plot4, eval=TRUE}
png(file = "plot4.png", width = 480, height = 480)

par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar = c(4,5,3,2))

## plot 1
plot(x = housePowerConsume2Day$DateTime, y = housePowerConsume2Day$Global_active_power, type = "line", xlab = "", ylab = "Global Active Power")

## plot 2
plot(x = housePowerConsume2Day$DateTime, y = housePowerConsume2Day$Voltage, type = "line", xlab = "datetime", ylab = "Voltage")

## plot 3
plot(x = housePowerConsume2Day$DateTime, y = housePowerConsume2Day$Sub_metering_1, type = "line", xlab = "", ylab = "Energy sub metering", col = "black")
lines(x = housePowerConsume2Day$DateTime, y = housePowerConsume2Day$Sub_metering_2, type = "line", col = "red")
lines(x = housePowerConsume2Day$DateTime, y = housePowerConsume2Day$Sub_metering_3, type = "line", col = "blue")
legend("topright", lty = 1, col = c("black", "red", "blue"), legend = c("Sub_metering_1", "Sub_metering_2", "Sub_metering_3"), type, bty = "n")

## plot 4
plot(x = housePowerConsume2Day$DateTime, y = housePowerConsume2Day$Global_reactive_power, type = "line", xlab = "datetime", ylab = "Global_reactive_power")

dev.off()
```
